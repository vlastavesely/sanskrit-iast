Sanskrit Transliteration Tool
=============================
This is a tool for romanisation of Sanskrit texts written in the Devanagari
script.

The program offers you two different modes of transliteration: by default, it
romanises Sanskrit texts written in the Devanagari script using the
International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST); alternatively it
can be used for reverse transliteration of IAST encoded texts into the
Devanagari script.
