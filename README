Sanskrit Transliteration Tool
=============================
This is a tool for romanisation of Sanskrit texts written in the Devanagari
script. It handles only the classic Sanskrit character set so it cannot be
used to transliterate modern Hindi.

The program is able to perform bidirectional transliteration: by default, it
romanises Sanskrit texts written in Devanagari using the International Alphabet
of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST); alternatively it can be used for reverse
transliteration of IAST encoded texts into Devanagari.

For more details on the usage of the program and the requirements for the input
data, see the included manual page iast(1).
