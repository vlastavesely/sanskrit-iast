Sanskrit Transliteration Tool
=============================
This is a tool for romanization of sanskrit texts written in the devanagari
script. The program offers you two different modes of transliteration: by
default, it transliterates a devanagari text using the International Alphabet
of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST); alternatively, it can be used for
simplified transliteration into czech language.
