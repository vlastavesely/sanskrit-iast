.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiast\fR is a tool for the lossless transliteration of Sanskrit terms written
in Devanagari into Latin using the IAST scheme (International Alphabet of
Sanskrit Transliteration).

The program allows to perform transliteration either on all non-option
arguments or on whole files specified by the \fB-f\fR option. By default, it
performs transliteration from Devanagari to a corresponding romanised version,
but using the \fB-r\fR switch, reverse transliteration can be performed, converting
romanised texts back into Devanagari.

.SH ENCODING
When the flag \fB-e\fR is set on, the program converts purely ASCII-encoded strings
into the special characters of the IAST alphabet. For example, it converts
‘sam.skr.tam’ to ‘saṃskṛtam’ or ‘s,a-stram’ to ‘śāstram’.

The encoding scheme is based on the following principle: characters ‘-’, ‘.’,
‘,’ and ‘~’ are considered to be modifiers that modify a letter that stands
before the modifier. For example, if the string to be encoded contains ‘a-’,
it will be encoded as ‘ā’ and the sequence ‘n~’ as ‘ñ’ and so on. The only
exception from the rule is the letter ‘n’ because it can be encoded both with
an over-dot (ṅ) and under-dot (ṇ). For the over-dot variant, the conversion
sequence is ‘n^.’.

Alternatively, the Czech characters ‘á’, ‘í’, ‘ú’, ‘š’ and ‘ň’ can be used as
shortcuts to encode the letters ‘ā’, ‘ī’, ‘ū’, ‘ś’ and ‘ñ’ respectively.
